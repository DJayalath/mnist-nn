# MNIST-NN
##### Shallow neural network for classifiying hand-written digits using the MNIST dataset. 
This project is for learning purposes only and is an attempt at implementing [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) and converting it into a fully matrix form
## Features
- Cross-entropy cost function
- Optimized weight initialisation
- Stochastic gradient descent (using mini batches)
- Fully vectorised (elements in mini batch processed simultaneously in matrix)
- L2 regularization
- Dynamic updating cost vs epoch graph
